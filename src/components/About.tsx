            <h2>About me</h2>
            I'm currently a 4th Computer Science student working towards my Bachelor of Computer Science at Carleton University.
            I've always been curious about how things work — the inner mechanisms — and drawn to the process of creating.
            Over time, my interests have ranged from architecture to mechanical design, and ultimately to computer science, where I believe by strong fascination with technology and building things truly align.
